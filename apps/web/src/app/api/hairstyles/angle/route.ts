Maintain the exact left-right orientation from the uploaded references. Do not horizontally flip the face, hair part, hair flow, facial asymmetry, jacket zipper, hand position, or background landmarks.
Facial consistency is more important than beautification. Do not make the face slimmer, wider, older, younger, heavier, thinner, sharper, softer, more handsome, or more doll-like.
Keep the same cheek fullness, jaw width, chin shape, nose size, eye spacing, eyelid shape, mouth shape, facial asymmetry, and natural expression tone from the uploaded identity references.
Replace the entire visible hairstyle with the requested style: hairline, fringe, crown, top volume, side line, texture, and silhouette.
The final image must visibly show the requested hairstyle and must not keep the original uploaded hairstyle.
Hair length and silhouette lock: all nine consultation angles must depict ONE single haircut with the exact same hair length, overall volume, and outer silhouette. ${hasBaseReference ?

A long style stays long from every camera position; a short style stays short from every camera position.
Keep the image suitable for a hair stylist to understand the cut and styling direction.
Keep face and clothing tone consistent with the selected style reference, while changing camera angle and expression enough to avoid duplicate-looking images.
For crown, rear, rear-three-quarter, and strict side profile requests, the camera position is more important than showing the full face. It is acceptable for the face to be partly hidden or not visible when the requested stylist reference angle requires it.

Hairstyle name:
${styleName}

Hairstyle details:
${stylePrompt}

View angle:
${anglePrompt}

Non-negotiable angle contract:
${buildAngleContract(angleLabel)}

The requested camera position is mandatory.
If the selected hairstyle reference is not front-facing and this request asks for the CENTER or a front-facing slot, rotate the same face and hairstyle into an exact front-facing portrait. Do not keep the selected reference's side gaze for a front-facing slot.
This request is for one image that will be placed into a larger app grid later. Do not draw the app grid.
Never mirror the same side for every result. If this request says customer's LEFT side, LEFT profile, or LEFT-REAR, that side must dominate. If this request says customer's RIGHT side, RIGHT profile, or RIGHT-REAR, that side must dominate. If this request says CENTER or exact front-facing, both eyes and both cheeks must be balanced. If this request says TOP CENTER, show the crown from above. If this request says REAR CENTER or BOTTOM CENTER, show the rear/back view with no face.
Single finished portrait only. Never create a 3x3 grid, collage, contact sheet, multi-panel layout, thumbnail board, before-after comparison, split screen, text, watermark, extra people, hats, or sunglasses.

Identity priority rule: the original uploaded customer photos are the only authority for face, identity, skin tone, makeup/no-makeup tone, expression, facial proportions, and real clothing. Celebrity references have zero identity authority, and generated stage references may contain drift.
Use celebrity references only for hairstyle attributes: length, silhouette, bangs/fringe, parting, layers, curl pattern, texture, volume, color mood, wet/dry finish, and styling direction.
Before applying the hairstyle, infer the uploaded customer's face shape, forehead height, cheek fullness, jaw width, chin shape, head width, neck length impression, hairline, and head silhouette from the customer photos and generated stage references.
Synthesize the celebrity references into a customer-fit salon design: adjust fringe length and density, part ratio, side volume, crown height, layer start, curl size, nape length, and color intensity so the hairstyle flatters the customer instead of copying the celebrity hair mechanically.
If any reference detail would make the customer's face look wider, longer, heavier, older, or unbalanced, modify that detail while preserving the recognizable celebrity-inspired hair mood.
Never copy, average, blend, morph, or borrow the celebrity face, facial features, body, pose, identity, skin tone, makeup, clothing, or background. If any reference conflicts with the customer's face, discard the celebrity face completely and correct back to the original customer.
